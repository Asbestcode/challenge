## Tip Calculator
Create a program that calculates the total cost of a meal, including tip, based on the cost of the meal and the percentage of the tip.
### Steps
1. Create a new JavaScript file in VS Code.
2. Initialize and assign values to 2 variables:
   1. A variable which will hold the value of the meal cost.
   2. A variable which will hold the value of the tip percentage.
3. Calculate the tip amount by multiplying the meal cost by the tip percentage, and store the result in a variable called tipAmount.
4. Calculate the total cost of the meal, including tip, by adding the mealCost variable and the tipAmount variable, and store the result in a variable called totalCost.
5. Log out a message using the console.log() method that should look like this:
   // The total cost of your bill is: 33 euros
